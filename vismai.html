    <p><strong>Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani | How to make Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani?</strong>-There are<br> so many kinds of Biryanis across the world, and each one is unique. And they change in taste and <br>form depending on the region where they are made.</p>

    <p>But then there may be innumerable Biryanis, but “Hyderabadi Dum Biryani” has its own place.<br> Sourness, spice and taste in it are all unique. In fact, Hyderabadi Dum Biryani or Mutton Dum <br<Biryani first and only then Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryanis have found their name.</p>
    <p>Though Hyderabadi Biryani has been introduced by the Nizams, Andhras have added their own<br> spices and made it even tastier. Biryani should be cooked on the wood fire, and only then it is<br> authentic say Biryani Masters. But now that we do not use wood fire much, we could still get the<br> same taste cooking on a gas stove.</p>
    <p>When I learned how to make Biryani, it was a big challenge for me to make small quantities, just for<br> 4 -5 people. I tried many times, reduced the spices and made it. But still, there was a problem in<br> Dum, or it was too hard, or there was burnt crust at the bottom. But every time, I had the<br> satisfaction that I learned something new. So this recipe is based on a lot of experience. And I have<br> a detailed explanation on what could go wrong and what to do.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2><hr>
    <h3>What kind of rice to use?:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I have used Basmati Rice, soaked for an hour, for this recipe. The Rice should always be older than a year.<br> Only then you will get a good grain.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Can we use Sona Masuri?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sona Masuri can also be washed and soaked for an hour. But it needs a little bit more Dum. And more<br> Water should be added for the Dum.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Can we increase the measures to double to make double the quantity?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            More or less, yes. But whenever I make double, I add only 1.3/4. That is Salt or Mirchi that I add for a cup<br> of Rice is increased to 1.3/4 cup or spoons only while cooking double. How much ever technology we<br> may have, I bet that it cannot precisely determine the taste each human being likes. I have given my<br> regular ingredients. But it is always better for you to taste and decide on your measurements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When the Biryani is doubled, should the Dum be for a longer time?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Half the duration is enough. I have used 1.1/2 Cups Rice for this recipe and 15 minutes of Dum<br> is enough. If you make 3 cups Rice, it is enough to Dum it for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Biryani should never be mixed while got. The stove should be switched off and left like that<br> for 20 minutes. Even the vessel should not be kept down on the floor. Otherwise, the heat settles<br> to the bottom and then on to the floor and the Biryani Dum does not cook enough. So you<br> should leave it on the stove.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why is the Chicken rubbery with no Masala sticking to it?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken should always be less than a kilo. An older, bigger Chicken does not cook well.</li>

        <li>If the Chicken has to soak in all the flavours, then it has to be marinated in a fridge overnight<br> and then it is tender after Dum.</li>
            
        <li>I have used tissues for this Biryani Dum. You could use Banana Leaves or a leaf plate.</li>
            
        <li>You should have equal parts of Rice and Chicken for Chicken Biryani. Whatever the measure I<br> took, I added double the Chicken.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How will we know Rice is 70 % cooked?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you test the grain with your fingers, it should be cooked more than half and should have some<br> brittleness. That is 70% cooking.</li>

        <li>If the Rice is soaked for an hour, then every 1.1/2 cups of Rice cooks 10% every 3-4 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to prevent Biryani from burning at the bottom?:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use only a thick-bottomed Vessel. In case you do not have such vessels, use a thick-bottomed cooker</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Does the Chicken gets cooked in 15 minutes?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If a tender Chicken is marinated in spices for 2 hours or overnight, it definitely gets cooked. Even after<br> you switch off the stove, it gets cooked more in Dum.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Finally, some tips to make the Biryani tastier:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I have used Fried Onions as I had some. If you fry Onions in Oil and then use that Oil in the<br> Biryani, the Biryani will get a nice aroma.</li>

        <li>Chicken Biryani tastes better with more Ghee.</li>
            
        <li>If you add Lemon Juice to Rice while it is boiling, then the Rice stays white.</li>
            
        <li>The Rice should be added only when the Water is boiling, or Rice becomes sticky, and the<br> grains are not fluffy.</li>
            
        <li>Salt should be more in Biryani. If you taste the Water, it should taste like seawater. It is only the<br> Salt that you add to boiling water that gets into the Biryani. The Salt does not stick even if you<br> add later to the Biryani. So you must check Salt while the Rice is added to the boiling Water.</li>
    </ol>
